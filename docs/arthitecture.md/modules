# Corvus Corax Architecture

## Overview
Corvus Corax is a modular reconnaissance and analysis framework designed for extensibility, clarity, and structured intelligence gathering.

The system is built around a dynamic module loader that automatically detects and registers modules at runtime.

---

## Core Design Philosophy
Corvus Corax follows three principles:

1. Modularity — each capability exists as an independent module
2. Transparency — outputs are structured and readable
3. Extensibility — new modules can be added without modifying core logic

---

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Core Layer
Responsible for:
- module loading
- command parsing
- execution routing

Core does NOT contain intelligence logic.  
It only manages system orchestration.

---

### 2. Module Layer
Modules are stored inside:
Each module must define:
name = "command_name"
def run(args)...
The loader scans the folder and auto-registers modules.

---

### 3. Command Flow

User input → Parser → Loader → Module → Output

Execution pipeline:

1. User enters command
2. Core parses input
3. Loader finds matching module
4. Module executes
5. Output returned to user

---

### 4. Loader System

The loader dynamically imports modules:

- scans directory
- imports python files
- validates module structure
- registers command name

This ensures:

- zero hardcoding
- plug-and-play modules
- scalable architecture

---

### 5. Output Philosophy

Corvus outputs are designed to be:

- structured
- readable
- actionable

Future versions will standardize output format across all modules.

---

### 6. Planned Evolution

Future engine: *Nexus Correlation Engine*

Goal:
Combine outputs from multiple modules and generate:

- risk scores
- intelligence links
- probability analysis
- structured reports

Nexus will transform Corvus from a toolkit into an intelligence system.

---

## Architectural Vision

Corvus Corax is not designed as a tool.

It is designed as a system.

A system that observes.
A system that correlates.
A system that reveals.

> See the unseen.
